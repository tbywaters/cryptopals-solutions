# crytopals-solutions
These are my solutions to the cryptopals challenges using PYTHON. All challenges can be found here: https://cryptopals.com/. This is currently a work in progress. Each challenge file contains only the code specific to that challenge. All other code, for example ciphers, attacks and bytes operations are separted into different files for easier use in later challenges. 

All code is written in python 3.7.3 

Where is challenge 19? My attempt at solving 19 turns out to be the solution to Challenge 20. Oops. I'll come back to Challenge 19 another time.
